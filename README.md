# enterprise-ops-agent
The OpsAgent is a multi-agent system that automates the triage process. It analyzes failure logs, identifies the likely root cause, suggests a verified fix, and, with human approval, executes a predefined runbook action (like restarting a service or rolling back a configuration). This reduces mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) by 60%.
